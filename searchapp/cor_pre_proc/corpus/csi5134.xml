<course><title>CSI 5134 Fault Tolerance (3 units)</title><desc>Hardware and software techniques for fault tolerance. Topics include modeling and evaluation techniques, error detecting and correcting codes, module and system level fault detection mechanisms, design techniques for fault-tolerant and fail-safe systems, software fault tolerance through recovery blocks, N-version programming, algorithm-based fault tolerance, checkpointing and recovery techniques, and survey of practical fault-tolerant systems. This course is equivalent to COMP 5004 at Carleton University.Course Component: Lecture</desc></course>
