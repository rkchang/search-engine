<course><title>CSI 5165 Combinatorial Algorithms (3 units)</title><desc>Design of algorithms for solving problems that are combinatorial in nature, involving exhaustive generation, enumeration, search and optimization. Algorithms for generating basic combinatorial objects (permutations, combinations, subsets) and for solving hard optimization problems (knapsack, maximum clique, minimum set cover). Metaheuristic search, backtracking, branch-and-bound. Computing isomorphism of combinatorial objects (graphs), isomorph-free exhaustive generation. This course is equivalent to COMP 5709 at Carleton University.Course Component: Lecture</desc></course>
