<course><title>CSI 5180 Topics in Artificial Intelligence (3 units)</title><desc>Selected topics in Artificial Intelligence (A.I.); could include A.I. programming techniques, pattern matching systems, natural language systems, rule-based systems, constraint systems, machine learning systems, and cognitive systems. Applications could include areas in Finance, Medicine, Manufacturing, Smart Cities, Semantic Web, Healthcare, Fraud Detection, Intrusion Detection, Autonomous Vehicles, Opinion mining, Sentiment Analysis or similar areas. Assignments will be both (a) programming-oriented, requiring implementation and/or extensions of prototypes in Lisp and/or Prolog and (b) research-oriented, requiring readings of special topics in current A.I. journals. This course is equivalent to COMP 5100 at Carleton University.Course Component: Lecture</desc></course>
