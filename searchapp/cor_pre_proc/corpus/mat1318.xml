<course><title>MAT 1318 Functions (3 units)</title><desc>Polynomial and rational functions: factoring, the remainder theorem, families of polynomials with specified zeros, odd and even polynomial functions. Logarithms and exponentials to various bases, their laws. Trigonometric functions: radian measure, values of primary trigonometric ratios, compound angle formulae, trigonometric identities. Solving equations and inequalities involving absolute values, polynomial, rational, logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric functions. Their graphs.  Operations on functions: point-wise addition and multiplication, composition; inverse functions. Average and instantaneous rate of change, approximating instantaneous rate of change, secants and tangents to graphs. Applications to graphing and finding maxima and minima of functions. Using functions to model, interpolate, and extrapolate data.   MAT1318 may be taken for upgrading purposes as an admission requirement. In all cases, credits for this course do not count as part of any program requirements.
