Fundamental structures: functions, relations, sets. The basics of counting: counting arguments, the pigeonhole principle, permutations and combinations.  Introduction to proofs: direct, by contradiction, by cases, induction. Topics in graph theory: isomorphism, cycles, trees, directed graphs.  Whenever possible applications from computing and information technology will be included.Course Component: Discussion Group, LecturePrerequisite: MAT 1318 or Ontario 4U Advanced Functions (MHF4U) or equivalent.
