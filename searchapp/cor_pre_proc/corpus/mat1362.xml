Concepts are introduced using sets of integers, integers modulo n, rational, real and complex numbers. Exploration of the real line: completeness, supremum, sequences and limits. Some of the concepts will be illustrated with examples from geometry, algebra and number theory.Course Component: Discussion Group, LecturePrerequisite: MAT 1339 or Ontario 4U Calculus and Vectors (MCV4U) or an equivalent.
