said it asked the U.S. Department of Transportation to approve
an increase in the number of its weekly roundtrip flights to
Buenos Aires to 11 from five.
    It said if several of Pan Am Corp's &lt;PN&gt; one-stop flights
to Buenos Aires were terminated in Rio de Janeiro, Eastern
could add four non-stop flights from the U.S.
    The expanded weekly schedule would include seven nonstop
flights from Miami, two from New York, and two one-stop flights
from Los Angeles via Lima. It asked for the change by June 12.
