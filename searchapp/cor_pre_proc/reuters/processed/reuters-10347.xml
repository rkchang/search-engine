&lt;HNKG.F&gt; said it is selling its Hamburg vegetable oil and fats
subsidiary Noblee und Thoerl GmbH to Oelmuehle Hamburg AG.
    A company spokesman declined to give the purchase price.
Noblee, a supplier of specialised refined oils and fats to the
food processing industry, had turnover of 161 mln marks last
year.
    A Henkel statement said the divestment was part of the
company's strategy of concentrating on its core businesses. For
Oelmuehle, the acquisition of Noblee means access to new
markets, the statement added.
