adopted today by the government, allows the Finance Ministry to
issue up to 14,600 billion yen worth of foreign exchange fund

    Foreign exchange dealers said the yen funds would be used
to buy dollars, to prevent a further dollar fall.

50 days of the year starting April 1, accounts for more than 90
pct of the 16,000 billion yen in bills incorporated in the full
budget.
