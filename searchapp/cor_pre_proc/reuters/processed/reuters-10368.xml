are charging the Dutch unit of International Business Machines
Corp &lt;IBM.N&gt; with unfair trading practices, saying its prices
undercut the leasing market, a court spokesman said.
    He said the three firms started summary proceedings in the
Amsterdam district court yesterday against IBM Nederland NV and
its leasing finance subsidiary IBM Nederland Financieringen BV.
A verdict is expected on April 16.
    The three firms suing IBM here are IBL Holland BV, ICA
Europe BV and Econocom Nederland BV. An IBM Nederland spokesman
said the firm denied the charges but declined further comment.
