</title><body>The government welcomed a wage settlement
for public sector workers which was agreed late last night as a
fair compromise for both sides, government spokesman Friedhelm
Ost told reporters.
    The wage settlement gives 2.3 mln workers in federal, state
and local governments a 3.4 pct wage increase for 1987,
retroactive from January 1.
    The public sector union OeTV had originally sought a six
pct increase, while the government's initial offer was 2.7 pct.
