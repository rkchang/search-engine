said its arms subsidiary, &lt;AB Bofors&gt;, plans to sell its 40 pct
stake in &lt;Allied Ordnance Co of Singapore Ltd&gt; because of its
part in weapons exports which contravene Swedish law.
    "The events we have uncovered are unacceptable and highly

Lars-Erik Thunholm told a news conference.
    Nobel managing director Anders Carlberg said an internal

smuggling.
