by Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD&gt; &lt;ST&gt;, scheduled its annual
maintenance refinery shutdowns during the next two months,
company spokeswoman Judy Wish said.
    Wish said refineries will stockpile production before the
shutdowns to maintain normal supply while maintenance is
carried out.
    Production at Shell's major refinery at Strathcona Alberta,
will be closed for about one month, Wish said.
    There will be no layoffs associated with the refinery
maintenance, she added.
