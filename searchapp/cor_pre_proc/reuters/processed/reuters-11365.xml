&lt;FIAT.MI&gt; plans greater involvement in emerging high-technology
sectors which it believes will represent an increasing share of
advanced economies, a group executive said.
    Francesco Gallo, senior vice-president of international
activities, told a conference that Fiat was "fully aware that in
the years to come, the automotive industry will not be among
the fastest growing businesses."
    The group, with estimated revenue last year of 29,020
billion lire, would develop further in space and defence,
telecommunications, bioengineering, and aviation, he said.
