the distribution of the common shares of its Grow Ventures Corp
subsidiary scheduled for today.
    The company said the spinoff, which is subject to required
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other
conditions, has been delayed due to the commission's heavy
workload, which has not permitted a review of Grow Group's
filings.
    As soon as these filings are processed by the SEC a new
distribution date will be announced, the company said.
