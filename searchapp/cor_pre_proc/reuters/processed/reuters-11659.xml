State Savings Bank was ordered sent to prison for his part in
the bank's 1985 collapse.
    Burton Bongard, 46, was sentenced to 15 years in prison,
five years of which were suspended, and ordered to pay 114 MLN
dlrs in restitution for mishandling the bank's money. He was
also ordered to pay 800,000 dlrs in court costs.

    ESM folded in March of 1985, taking its biggest investor,
Home State, along with it.
