</title><body>A Brazilian delegation, led by central
bank president Francisco Gros, will meet Brazil's bank advisory
committee here on April 10, said Citibank's William Rhodes as
Chairman of the 14-bank committee.
    Rhodes said in a statement that the parties are expected to
discuss Brazil's economic plans and "interim arrangements." He
did not elaborate further.
    This meeting will be the first here since Brazil's
unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs
of commercial bank debt on February 20. The two sides held
inconclusive talks in Miami on March 22, bankers said.
