Boliden AB &lt;BLDS.ST&gt; said the takeover of the U.S.
Allis-Chalmers Corp's &lt;AH.O&gt; mining machinery division made it
the world's leading maker of such equipment.
    President Kjell Nilsson, announcing the 600 mln crown deal,
told a news conference Boliden would now become a truly
international concern with operations in Brazil, Chile and
other big minerals-producing nations.
    He said the Allis-Chalmers' division, accounting for some
50 pct of the U.S. Group's sales, would fit in well into
Boliden.
