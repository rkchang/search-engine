billion dollars in soft loan aid over the next three years, to
be split between project investment and balance of payment
requirements, the World Bank said in a statement.
    It said after a two-day meeting of the Consultative Group
for Senegal held here under its auspices the aid was to support
the second phase, running to mid-1990, of Senegal's "courageous
and far-reaching" medium and long-term adjustment programme.
