will market electronic data transmission equipment of its own
design in North America, a spokesman said.
    The spokesman told Reuters the equipment, known as
fourth-generation modems, will be sold by &lt;Mitel Datacom Inc&gt;,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canada's Mitel Corp &lt;MLT.TO&gt;, in
which British Telecom has a controlling stake.

majority share of the market, were the first of their kind to
comply with the latest international standards.
