venture set up by ITT Corp &lt;ITT&gt; and France's &lt;Cie Generale
d'Electricite&gt;, has accepted a proposal from the Industry
Ministry to restructure ITT's former Spanish subsidiary,
&lt;Standard Electrica SA&gt;, a Standard spokesman said.
    He said Alcatel also has agreed to sell &lt;Marconi Espanola

company, Compania Telefonica Nacional de Espana SA &lt;TELF.MA&gt;,
which has a small stake in Standard and is its main customer.
