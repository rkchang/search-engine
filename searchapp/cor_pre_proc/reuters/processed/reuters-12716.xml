continue to talk with Regal International Inc &lt;RGL&gt; about being
acquired, but maintained it will pursue alternatives as part of
its reorganization plan.
    Any plan of reorganization Bell arrives at would be subject
to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Midland, Texas,
Bell said.
    The agreement also terminates all current litigation
between Regal and Bell involving previous reorganization plans,
in which Regal attempted to acquire Bell, the company said.
