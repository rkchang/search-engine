the new personal computers announced yesterday by International
Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM&gt; are expected to have little
near-term effect on Digital Communications.
    The company said some product modifications will be
required, but they appear to be straight forward and do not
represent major development challenges.
    The company said it will pursue two prime areas -- the
configuration of its products for use with Mocrosoft Corp's
&lt;MSFT&gt; new operating system which has been adopted for use in
the IBM products, and changes requried by the use of a new bus
architecture in certain IBM products.
