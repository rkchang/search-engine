make a two-for-five bonus issue out of its revaluation reserve
to shareholders registered May 26.
    Shareholders will be asked to approve the issue and an
increase in authorised capital to 175 mln shares from 125 mln
at a general meeting on May 1, it said in a statement.

latest annual dividend rate of 29 cents a share on the enlarged
capital.
