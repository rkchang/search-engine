CCC-plus from B-minus Lanesborough Corp's 50 mln dlrs of senior
subordinated notes.

purchase of Ampex Corp from Allied-Signal Inc &lt;ALD&gt; for 479 mln
dlrs.
    "The acquisition represents a dramatic departure from
management's stated financial policies," S and P said. It also

venture with extremely high financial risk.
