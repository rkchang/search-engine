negotiating to increase its holding in U.S. Engineering and
electrical installations firm &lt;Comstock&gt;.
    Spie Batignolles, a subsidiary of Schneider SA &lt;SCHN.PA&gt;,
said in a statement it was negotiating to invest 20 mln dlrs in
Comstock in the form of bonds convertible into shares.
    Spie Batignolles has held a 20 pct stake in Comstock since

all the new bonds, it could open the way for the French company
to take control of Comstock but he gave no other details.
