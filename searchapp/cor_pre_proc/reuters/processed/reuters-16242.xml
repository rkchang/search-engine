</title><body>Leaders of the nation's unionized
automobile workers have signalled their intent for a major work
stoppage later this year if General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor
Co., fail to satisfy demands for job security, pay raises and
protection against shifting U.S. production to foreign sources.
    United Automobile Workers (UAW) president Owen Bieber was
loudly cheered by some 3,000 local delegates at a special
bargaining strategy convention yesterday when he declared the
1.1-mln-member union is ready to go to "war" against the major
auto makers in support of its goals.
    "It takes two to make peace, but only one to make war ...
and if it's war, the UAW will be ready for it. War against the
insecurity of layoff," the UAW chief said.
