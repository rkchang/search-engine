said its lower first quarter earnings included a loss of
63,055,000 dlrs from its equity in US Sprint.
    US Sprint was formed July 1, 1986, as a partnership which
combined United Telecommunications' long distance voice and
data operations with those of GTE Corp &lt;GTE&gt;.
    Earlier, United Telecommunications reported first-quarter
earnings of 12.6 mln dlrs, or 13 cts a share compared to 46.4
mln dlrs, or 47 cts a share a year ago. Revenues declined to
720.2 mln dlrs from 793.6 mln dlrs.
    United Telecommunications said the transition of US
Sprint's nationwide fiberoptic network is proceeding ahead of
schedule.
    It said the transition to the fiber network from interim
networks would not only reduce operating costs in the second
half of 1987, but also assist in controlling unauthorized
network use.
