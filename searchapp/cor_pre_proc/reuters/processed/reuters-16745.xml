</title><body>Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
told a press conference he expects the U.S. Trade deficit to
eventually start reflecting economic fundamentals, which should
influence exchange rates.
    The minister was not referring to the U.S. Trade data to be
released in Washington later today.
    Miyazawa also said he told major industrial nations when he
was in Washington last week that present exchange rates are not
necessarily good. He had said earlier in Washington that
current exchange rates were within levels implied in the
February Paris currency accord.
