Witco Corp, and the &lt;Knox Truck Stop&gt; chain, said they have
developed one of the nation's first fast-oil-change centers
for trucks outside of Dallas.
    The service, called Fast Lube, offers a 60-minute oil
change and inspection service for trucks and also involves a
used-oil analysis program that relays engine information to the
driver's fleet headquarters, the companies said.
    According to the companies, fast-oil-change centers are
expected to grow from the current three pct of the oil
lubrication market to 15 pct by 1990.
   
    In addition, Kendall said it recently launched a national
Fast Lube program with &lt;Avis Inc&gt; that provides participating
Avis Lube franchises with lubricants, equipment and marketing
support.
