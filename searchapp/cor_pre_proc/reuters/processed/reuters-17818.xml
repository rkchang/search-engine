</title><body>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
put Hospital Corp of America's nearly three billion dlrs of
long-term debt under review with uncertain direction.
    Under review are the A-2 senior debt, A-3 convertible
subordinated debt and Prime-2 commercial paper ratings.
    Moody's cited the firm's planned sale of 104 U.S.-based
hospitals to an employee stock ownership plan. The cost would
be 1.8 billion dlrs in cash plus preferred stock and warrants.
    Moody's expects favorable credit implications if the sale
includes low-profit hospitals. Reducing Hospital's financial
leverage will be needed to maintain credit quality, it said.
