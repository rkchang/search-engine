Hog Market Inc to the unit's employees through an Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).
    Terms were not disclosed, but president Bruce Bickner said
the sale will have a positive, but not substantial, impact on
DeKalb as a whole.
    The company said the hog marketing unit did not fit with
its strategy of investing in its core businesses.
