And Matra-Harris-Semiconducteurs (MHS) said their Cimatel joint
venture design facility was dissolved as from June 1.
    Intel makes logic and memory components. MHS is a joint
venture of the Matra group &lt;MATR.PA&gt; and Harris Corp &lt;HRS&gt;.
    Cimatel was formed in 1982 to design standard VLSI devices
for the telecommunications and computer graphics markets.
    MHS said in a statement that changing market conditions had
led Intel to reassess its marketing policy. It had concluded
that without common marketing goals a common design centre was
impractical.
