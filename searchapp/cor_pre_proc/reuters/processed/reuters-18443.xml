said it began building the world's most advanced energy-saving
tanker, which consumes only 48 tonnes of fuel oil a day.
    Construction of the 258,000 dwt VLCC (very large crude
carrier) Nisseki Maru for &lt;Tokyo Tanker Co Ltd&gt;, a shipping arm
of Nippon Oil Co Ltd &lt;NPOL.T&gt;, is expected to be completed in
April 1988. It would run on the Japan/Gulf route, a company
statement said.
    The statement gave no other details.
    Mitsubishi Heavy last year finished building a vlcc of
similar size, but which consumed 57 tonnes of fuel a day.
