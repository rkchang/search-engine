dlrs in early May for a five pct stake in &lt;Zoran Corp&gt;, a
California-based maker of large scale integrated circuits (LSI)
with computer graphic, communications and medical applications,
a Mitsui spokesman told Reuters.
    He said the two firms will form a marketing company in
Japan as early as next year, although details of the joint

    Zoran was founded in 1981 and now has about 100 employees,
he said.
