(CCC) has reallocated 1.3 mln dlrs in credit guarantees
originally granted to cover the sale of protein meals to El
Salvador so it may buy rice, the U.S. Agriculture Department
said.
    The action reduces the guarantee line authorized for sales
of protein meals to 12.7 mln dlrs and creates a rice credit
guarantee line of 1.3 mln dlrs, the department said.
    All sales under the credit guarantee lines must be
registered and exports completed by September 30, the
department said.
