</title><body>&lt;Goldman Sachs and Co&gt; is not facing
severe financial problems and has not filed for protection
under U.S. Bankruptcy laws, Robert Conway, managing director of
Goldman Sachs International Corp said.
    He was responding to a Reuter enquiry about rumours in
London financial markets that the firm was in financial
trouble.
    "There is absolutely, positively no truth to those rumours,"
he said noting that in the current financial environment
rumours like this are bound to surface.
    Conway said that Goldman Sachs has had an excellent year
and that it has a strong balance sheet and good liquidity.
    "You can't be in the equity market as we are and not
experience some problems after a day like yesterday (when the
Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 508 points). But we are
not facing any severe financial problems," he added.
