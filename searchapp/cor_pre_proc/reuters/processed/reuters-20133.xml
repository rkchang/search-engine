Inc said it has temporarily suspended printing new titles for
its Soaps and Serials line of paperback books and will now
print only those titles that have demonstrated a profitable
sales history.
    It said it will no longer sell the entire Soaps and Serials
line as a unit but will take orders for individual titles.
    The company said it currently has enough licensor-approved
manuscripts to provide, after publication, for at least six
months of retail operations.
