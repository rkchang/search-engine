four weeks ended February 28 for its Bradlees Discount
Department Stores Division were up six pct to 104 mln dlrs from
98 mln dlrs a year before, with same-store sales up three pct. 
    The company said the modest comparable store sales increase
was due to a combination of difficult weather conditions in the
Northeast, a later Easter this year and a possible slowing in
consumer demand.
