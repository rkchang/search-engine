</title><body>Circle Express Inc said negotiations
on its proposed acquisitions of Overland Express Inc and
privately-held Continental Training Services Inc have been

    The company said the recent declines in stock prices have
made it unlikely that the transactions could qualify as
tax-free reorganizations.
