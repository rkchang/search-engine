</title><body>The House Budget Committee approved a
package of 23 billion dlrs in taxes and budget cuts to reduce
the 1988 budget deficit.
    The 20-14 party-line vote by the Democratic-controlled
committee sends the measure to the full House where House
Speaker Jim Wright predicted passage next week.
    The package--including 12 billion dlrs in taxes President
Reagan has vowed to veto--was put together by other committees
under a new budget law requiring a 23 billion dlr cut in the
deficit to scale down the 1988 budget deficit.
