Co Inc said it withdrew its offer to acquire Delchamps Inc
&lt;DLCH.O&gt; for 27 dlrs a share or about 175 mln dlrs, which was
made earlier this month.
    Michael Rourke, A and P vice president, said the company
withdrew the offer because Delchamps did not respond favorably
to it and because of market conditions.
    He would not comment on whether A and P would make another
offer to acquire Delchamps.
