said he has delivered requests for a special meeting of
Cleveland-Cliffs Inc &lt;CLF&gt; shareholders representing more than
25 pct of the total voting shares in the company.
    Bolger, who heads a group that owns 6.4 pct of
Cleveland-Cliff's outstanding stock, said he is seeking the
special meeting to remove the current board of directors and
elect his nominees.
    The Bolger group had called for a special shareholder
meeting prior to the company's recent issuance of four mln new
shares, Bolger said.
