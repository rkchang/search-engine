SA&gt; is negotiating to buy the property assets of U.S. media
company Cannon Group Inc &lt;CAN&gt;, Renta's finance director Jose
Luis Sanchez said.
    Sanchez told Reuters that Renta's chairman Juan Antonio
Robles was currently in the U.S. to negotiate the deal but
declined to give other details.
    Interpart, a Luxembourg-based holding company chaired by
Italian financier Giancarlo Paretti, payed around 12.2 billion
pesetas in July to acquire a 63.5 pct stake in Renta
Inmobiliaria.
    The Spanish daily newspaper El Pais said the Cannon
property assets sought by Renta included the Elstree film
studios in Britain and a chain of movie-theaters in Europe and
the U.S.
