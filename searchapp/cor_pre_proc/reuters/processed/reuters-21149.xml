Maryland, a unit of Bell Atlantic Corp, is raising 100 mln dlrs
via an offering of notes due 1992 with a 10-1/4 pct coupon and
par pricing, said lead underwriter Morgan Stanley.
    That is 46 basis points more than the yield of comparable
Treasury securities.
    Non-callable for life, the issue is rated Aa-3 by Moody's
Investors Service and AA-minus by Standard and Poor's. Late
last week, Moody's and S and P downgraded the telephone
company's debt ratings, underwriters noted.
