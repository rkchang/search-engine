telemarketing services to other companies through a newly
established wholly-owned subsidiary, Telemarketing Network Inc.
    The New York-based subsidiary will use a network of 14
telemarketing centers Penney has already established. The
centers are part of its catalog marketing operation.
    A large domestic motel chain already uses the network for
its reservations services, Penney said.

of the new subsidiary.
