to change its name to Primerica Corp, subject to approval by
shareholders at the April 28 annual meeting.
    It said its new New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol would
be &lt;PA&gt;.
    American Can sold all its packaging operations -- and
rights to the American Can name -- to Triangle Industries Inc
&lt;TRI&gt; in November.
    The company said the new name gives it flexibility as it
moves into new areas of enterprise.  American Can is now
involved in financial services and specialty retailing.
