</title><body>Lloyds Bank Plc said it is cutting its
base lending rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct, effective tomorrow.
    The reduction follows similar moves from the three other
British clearing banks.
    National Westminster Bank Plc led the way this morning
after the Bank of England lowered its dealing rates in a signal
that it would tolerate a half percentage point reduction.
    The central bank's surprise signal followed its strenuous
efforts last week to prevent market forces from bringing down
base rates before the U.K. Budget on March 17.
