the airline has no comment on USAir Group Inc's planned buyout
of Piedmont Aviation Inc.
    TWA, however, has pursued its application with the
Department of Transportation for a takeover of USAir, according
to Mark Buckstein, TWA general counsel and vice president. TWA
filed a revised application today, following the DOT's
rejection Friday of an incomplete application filed last week.
    Earlier USAir said it agreed to buy Piedmont for 69 dlrs
cash per share.
