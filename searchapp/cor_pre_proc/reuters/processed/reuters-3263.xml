&lt;ICGS.L&gt;, IC Gas, said its board is not making a recommendation
on the partial tender offfer at 710p per share announced by
&lt;Tractebel SA&gt; and &lt;Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA&gt;.
    At the same time, however, the board would not recommend a
general offer for all the shares at a price of 710p, the
statement added.
    Shareholders wondering whether to tender either to the
Tractebel consortium or to the rival 700p per share partial
offer from &lt;SHV Holdings NV&gt; should consult professional
advisers.
