receive a qualified opinion from auditors on its 1986 and 1985
financial statements.
    It said the qualification related to its inability to
determine the effects, if any, of the final resolution of a
suit filed against it by &lt;Washington Public Power Supply
System&gt;.  The 1985 suit was dismissed in a 1986 lower court
action, but the ultimate outcome of the matter is still
uncertain since Washington Public Power has appealed to the
U.S. Court of Appeals.
