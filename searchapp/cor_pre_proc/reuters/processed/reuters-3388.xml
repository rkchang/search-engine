Corp, said it was increasing its contract prices for crude oil
between 10 cts and one dlr a barrel, effective today.
    Conoco said the increase brings its price for the U.S.
benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate to 17.50 dlrs a barrel,
up one dlr.
    South Louisiana Sweet, also up one dlr, is now 17.85 dlrs.
West Texas Sour was up 10 cts to 16.60 dlrs a barrel.
    Conoco was the last company to raise prices following a
series of increases initiated last week by Sun Co &lt;SUN&gt;, which
reversed the posted price cuts made at the end of February.
