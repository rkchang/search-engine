introduced OnePlus Wats, a telecommunications service for high
volume callers.
    Metromedia said OnePlus uses a local switched network
rather than dedicated connections to link customers to the
nearest Metromedia Long Distance switching center and could
save customers up to 35 pct off of competitors' rates for long
distance service.
