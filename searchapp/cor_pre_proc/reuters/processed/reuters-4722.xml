by-election with almost twice as many votes as its nearest
rival, the Press Association news agency reported.

called after the death of the previous member of parliament,
also a member of the Liberal party.
    Matthew Taylor raised the Liberal majority by winning
30,599 votes. Conservative Nicholas St Aubyn was second with
15,982 while Labour candidate John King polled 3,603.
