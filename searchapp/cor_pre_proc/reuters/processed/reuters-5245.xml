it planned to slash 420 jobs this year from the 5,000 strong
workforce in its electrical equipment division.
    Details of the proposed staff reductions will be put to
labour representatives at a meeting on March 19.
    Company officials said the cuts were needed to adjust to a
drop in orders from French state utility Electricite de France
and the cancellation or postponement of unspecified export
contracts.
