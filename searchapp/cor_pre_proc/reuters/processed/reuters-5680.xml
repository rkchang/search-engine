environmental tests revealed low but unacceptable levels of two
chemical compounds in ground water at its Signore plant near
here.
    The tests, conducted by Dames and Moore, an environmental
engineering firm, followed the termination of talks for sale of
the plant, which makes steel office furniture.
    The company said the compounds were not used as part of its
current operations. Testing will continue, it said.
