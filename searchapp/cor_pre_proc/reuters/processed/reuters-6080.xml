proposed new higher minimum standards for sales of durum wheat
into intervention stores, European Community sources said.
    They said a document drawn up by Commission officials
proposes a reduction in the maximum humidity level to 13 pct
from 14, an increase in the minimum weight to 78 kilos per
hectolitre from 76, a tightening of other technical standards
and introduction of some new ones.
    Current public stocks of durum wheat in the EC are 1.15 mln
