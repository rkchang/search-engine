AG &lt;HOFZ.Z&gt; said it introduced a new anti-rheumatism drug with
the brand name tilcotil on the Swiss market starting today.
    The drug, developed by Roche itself, contains the substance
tenoxicam. The company said in a statement that tests had shown
its effectiveness against various types of rheumatism and
arthritis. It was attractive for sufferers because it worked
quickly and needed to be taken only once a day, Roche said.
