sharply following a report that Bristol-Myers Co &lt;BMY&gt; would
seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration permission to test its
aids vaccine in humans by the end of March, dealers said.
    Wellcome shares slumped to a quoted low of 453p on the
report after yesterday's 496p close but later rose to 464p.
    Earlier this month a Wellcome spokesman said the company
was applying for licences in the U.S. And several major
countries for its "Retrovir" drug which can be used for the
treatment of Aids. The U.K. Department of Health and Social
Security has already issued a marketing licence for "Retrovir."
