&lt;HSN&gt; said, in response to published reports, that it is not
the target of a formal Securities and Exchange commission

inquiry of all parties involved in the Home Shopping/C.O.M.B.

that caused the stocks to rise prior to a public announcement
in January.
    Home Shopping said it cooperated fully and had no
indication that the informal inquiry is being pursued.
