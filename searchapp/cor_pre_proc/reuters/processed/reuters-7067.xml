sent a letter to the ChemLawn Corp board, saying it is prepared
to increase its bid for ChemLawn to 33 dlrs a share,
from 27 dlrs, if ChemLawn promptly negotiates and executes a
simple two-step merger agreement containing only essential
covenants and conditions.
    Upon such an agreement, Waste Management said, it would
amend its 27 dlrs a share cash tender offer.
