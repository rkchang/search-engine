discontinuing its efforts to negotiate a purchase of the common
stock of Jones and Vining Inc.
    On February 6, Vulcan, a Cincinnati maker of shoe lasts and
other products, offered five dlrs a share for all of Jones and
Vining common, subject to certain conditions.
    Vulcan said it is dropping the proposal because it believes
subsequent actions by Jones and Vining are hostile and Vulcan
is only interested in a friendly transaction.
    Jones and Vining makes shoe lasts and shoe components. It
has about 3.7 mln shares outstanding.
