N.V. &lt;AKZO.AS&gt; said it agreed to take over household product
subsidiaries of French group Rhone-Poulenc &lt;RHON.PA&gt; for an
undisclosed sum.
    Under the agreement, Akzo will acquire the household
product activities of the Lyons-based &lt;Rhodic&gt; and
Remalard-based &lt;Buhler-Fontaine&gt; units of Rhone Poulenc.
Together, these activities account for over 180 mln French
francs in annual sales and employ 170, Akzo said.
    Akzo will integrate the firms, to be partially joined with
its own French activities, in its consumer products division.
