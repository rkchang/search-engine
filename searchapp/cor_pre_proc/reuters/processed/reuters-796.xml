Canada Inc unit said it acquired the Wallaceburg, Ontario,
metal can making operations of Nestle Enterprises Ltd, wholly
owned by &lt;Nestle SA&gt;, of Switzerland. Terms were undisclosed.
    Continental Can said it would supply Nestle's equivalent
can requirements under a long-term agreement.
    Nestle said it decided to stop manufacturing cans "in order
to be in a better position to take full advantage of the
changes underway or on the horizon in food packaging
technology."
