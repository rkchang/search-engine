for all GenCorp Inc shares at 100 dlrs each, said it has
started soliciting proxies against GenCorp's proposals to
increase its number of authorized shares outstanding, create a
board with staggered election dates and eliminate cumulative
voting.
    The proposals are to be voted on at the March 31 annual
meeting.
    General Partners, a partnership of privately-held &lt;Wagner
and Brown&gt; and AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG&gt;, made the disclosure in
a newspaper advertisement.
    The partnership has already filed suit in U.S. District
Court in Columbus, Ohio, seeking to block a vote on the
proposals and to invalidate GenCorp's defensive preferred share
purchase rights.
    General Partners asked shareholders to either vote against
the proposals or abstain from voting on them.
