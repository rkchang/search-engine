Adler, said he expects the company's first quarter earnings for
fiscal 1987 to be better than the same quarter a year ago.
    Adler said, however, that the quarter would still be a
loss, primarily because it is the low season for the imaging
business.
    Photo Moto recored a net loss for the first quarter 1986
ending March 31 of 328,889 dlrs.
