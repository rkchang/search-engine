Japanese autoparts maker owned 25 pct by Nissan Motor Co Ltd
&lt;NSAN.T&gt;, has exchanged a memorandum to acquire over 50 pct of
U.S. Autoparts firm &lt;Master-Cast Co&gt; to avoid losses on U.S.
Sales caused by the yen's rise against the dollar, a KKK
spokesman said.
    The final agreement should be signed this year when KKK
forms the new company &lt;Alfa K Technology&gt;, he said.
    The new firm should supply all the U.S. Major car makers,
including Ford Motor Co &lt;F&gt;, General Motor Corp &lt;GM&gt; and
Chrysler Corp &lt;C&gt;, he said.
