<reuters><date>25-MAR-1987 10:41:53.91</date><topics /><title>BEN EQUITY HOLDINGS &lt;BH&gt; SUSPENDED ON NYSE</title><body>The New York Stock Exchange said
trading in the units of BenEquity Holdings, a California
Limited Partnership, was suspended before the opening and an
application will be made to the Securities and Exchange
Commission to delist the issue.
    The Exchange said it normally considers suspending and
removing from its list the securities of a company when fewer
than 600,000 units are held by the public.
    As a result of a tender offer by &lt;Renouf Corp
International&gt;, which expired March 24, 1987, fewer than
600,000 units of BenEquity remained publicly held.
