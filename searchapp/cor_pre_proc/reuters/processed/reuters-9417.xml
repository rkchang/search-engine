to purchase a seat on the Montreal Stock Exchange for 40,000
dlrs, subject to regulatory and exchange approval.
    The move came two weeks after Toronto Dominion paid 195,000
dlrs for a seat on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which made it
the first bank to apply for membership on a Canadian exchange.
The Toronto and Montreal exchanges are Canada's two biggest
equity markets.
    Proposed Canadian government legislation would allow banks
full participation in the securities business after June 30.
Toronto Dominion has owned a discount brokerage since 1984.
