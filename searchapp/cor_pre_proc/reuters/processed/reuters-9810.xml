tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee said today President
Reagan must reconsider his consistent opposition to any tax
increases.
    The Illinois Democrat, asked on a television interview (on
NBC-Today) about the possibility of tax hikes, said, "I think
the president is going to have to reconsider."
    He added, "I just hope there's enough vision in this
administration to recognize that our deficits are intolerable
and the only way we're going to do it is by raising revenues."
